## Projects  
### Capstone Project  
Title: Automated Attendance System Using Facial Recognition  
Description: This project focuses on developing an automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and security. Traditional attendance methods, such as manual roll calls and paper sign-ins, are prone to errors and proxy attendance. 
The proposed system will leverage high-resolution cameras and advanced facial recognition algorithms to automatically mark attendance in real time. Designed for deployment at XY University, the system integrates with existing attendance management tools, ensuring seamless operation. By reducing administrative workload and minimizing inaccuracies, this solution provides a modern, tamper-proof approach to attendance tracking in educational and corporate environments.

### Other Projects  
Project Title: Enhancing Operational Functionality at Global Network Administrators Group
Description:
This project focused on improving operational efficiency and conflict resolution between the U.S. and India offices of Global Network Administrators Group. Due to the lack of supervision in the U.S. office, employees were not adhering to network issue response times and documentation policies, leading to inefficiencies and increased workload for the India office.

To address these challenges, the project implemented a transformational leadership approach, structured performance tracking, and collaborative conflict resolution strategies such as compromise and collaboration. Key initiatives included introducing structured communication channels, a shared ticketing system, and performance feedback mechanisms to ensure accountability, improve compliance, and enhance teamwork between the two offices. These strategies successfully fostered a culture of engagement, efficiency, and better workload distribution.

Project Title: Building a High-Performing IT Leadership Team
Description:
As the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of a local IT company, this project focused on developing a high-performing IT leadership team by fostering innovation, enhancing team commitment, and improving communication. Key strategies included cultivating psychological safety, implementing structured innovation frameworks like Design Thinking, and empowering employees through autonomy and recognition.

To overcome obstacles, the project leveraged political intelligence and cross-functional collaboration to align IT initiatives with business goals. Conflict resolution was managed through the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Model, while a unified communication system streamlined collaboration and knowledge sharing. By integrating these strategies, the project successfully enhanced organizational efficiency, innovation, and team cohesion, ensuring IT leaders could drive long-term success.
